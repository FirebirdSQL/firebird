Firebird Database Server 1.5 Final Release (Draft)
==================================================

This document is a guide to installing this package of 
Firebird 1.5 on the Win32 platform. These notes refer to the 
installation package itself, rather than Firebird 1.5 in general.

** IMPORTANT NOTE **

If you used one of the installable binaries from Sourceforge
to install RC2 it is recommended that you uninstall directly 
from the installation directory with unins000.exe. 

Do not use the Control Panel as the path to the uninstaller.
There appears to be a bug that prevents the server service 
from being shut down if the uninstaller is run from there. 

This only applies to the uninstaller with RC2 from Firebird on 
Sourceforge.

Before installation
-------------------

It is recommended that you UNINSTALL all previous versions of 
Firebird 1.0, Firebird 1.5 or InterBase before installing this package.


New features of the installer in Firebird 1.5
---------------------------------------------

o This installer now combines the super server and classic server 
  binaries into a single installation package. You can choose to 
  install one or the other, but not both. To switch server type 
  you need to uninstall and re-install.
  
o Libraries are no longer installed into the Windows system directory. This
  applies to both Firebird's own libraries and the Microsoft C run-time
  libraries. They are installed into the Firebird bin directory. This should
  resolve all installation conflicts, expecially on Windows 2000 and Windows 
  XP.

o If firebird.conf exists in the installation directory it is saved as
    firebird.conf.saved.n
  where n is a number. The installer always installs the default 
  firebird.conf file. This is to guarantee consistency to the installation 
  process. Otherwise the installer would have to parse the existing (and 
  possibly broken) configuration file.


Uninstallation
--------------

o It is preferred that this package be uninstalled correctly using  the 
  uninstallation application supplied. This can be called from the Control 
  Panel. Alternatively it can be uninstalled by running unins000.exe 
  directly from the installation directory.
  
o If Firebird is running as an application (instead of as a service) it is 
  recommended that you manually stop the server before running the uninstaller.
  This is because the uninstaller cannot stop a running application. If a
  server is running during the uninstall the uninstall will complete with 
  errors. You will have to delete the remnants by hand.


Other Notes
-----------

  Firebird requires WinSock2. All Win32 platforms should have this, 
  except for Win95. A test for the Winsock2 library is made during 
  install. If it is not found the install will fail. You can visit 
  this link:

  to find out how to go about upgrading.


Installation from a batch file
------------------------------

The setup program can be run from a batch file. This is useful if you wish
to install the client across a network. The following parameters may be passed:


/SP- 
  Disables the 'This will install... Do you wish to continue?' prompt at 
  the beginning of Setup. 

/SILENT, /VERYSILENT 
  Instructs Setup to be silent or very silent. When Setup is silent the 
  wizard and the background window are not displayed but the installation 
  progress window is. When a setup is very silent this installation 
  progress window is not displayed. Everything else is normal so for 
  example error messages during installation are displayed and the startup 
  prompt is (if you haven't disabled it with  the '/SP-' command line option 
  explained above) 

  If a restart is necessary and the '/NORESTART' command isn't used 
  (see below) and Setup is silent, it will display a Reboot now? 
  messagebox. If it's very silent it will reboot without asking. 

/NORESTART 
  Instructs Setup not to reboot even if it's necessary. 

/DIR="x:\dirname"  
  Overrides the default directory name displayed on the Select Destination 
  Directory wizard page. A fully qualified pathname must be specified. If 
  the [Setup] section directive DisableDirPage was set to yes, this command 
  line parameter is ignored. 

/GROUP="folder name" 
  Overrides the default folder name displayed on the Select Start Menu Folder 
  wizard page. If the [Setup] section directive DisableProgramGroupPage was 
  set to yes, this command line parameter is ignored. 

/NOICONS 
  Instructs Setup to initially disable the Don't create any icons check box 
  on the Select Start Menu Folder wizard page. 

/COMPONENTS="comma separated list of component names" 

  Choose from - SuperServerComponent, ClassicServerComponent, ServerComponent, 
                DevAdminComponent and ClientComponent

  Overrides the default components settings. Using this command line parameter 
  causes Setup to automatically select a custom type. A full install requires 
  combining components. For example:
  
  /COMPONENTS="SuperServerComponent, ServerComponent, DevAdminComponent, ClientComponent"
  
  would be required for a full install.
