2003-12-14 04:57  skywalker

	* firebird2/configure.in (1.141.2.18):

	LIBTOOLIZE=[path_to_libtooliize]/libtoolize; export LIBTOOLIZE
	./autogen.sh

	AC_PREREQ in configure.in and not by this script.
	
	Libtool version check may also pass obsolete versions.

	platform, simply create "builds/posix/postfix.<PLATFORM>".

	atexit, on_exit, (v)fork, set(p)grp, setpgid and flock	o added
	test for the keyword 'volatile'  o fixed errors in configure.in  o

	work for you, please extend the tests in configure.in, rather than
	defining this in prefix.your_system.

	* firebird2/configure.in (1.32):
